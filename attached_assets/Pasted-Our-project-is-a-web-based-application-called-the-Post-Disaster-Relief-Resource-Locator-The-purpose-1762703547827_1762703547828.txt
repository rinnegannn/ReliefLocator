Our project is a web-based application called the Post-Disaster Relief Resource Locator. The purpose of this website is to help people affected by natural disasters quickly find nearby emergency shelters, food banks, water stations, and medical centers. The website allows users to enter their postal code or enable location access, and then it displays all available relief centers on an interactive map. The map is built using the Google Maps API, and users can click on any pin to see detailed information such as the name of the center, its address, distance, contact information, and whether it is currently open. The site also includes filter options so users can choose to view only certain types of resources, such as shelters or medical aid.

For the backend, we are using Supabase as our main database. Supabase stores all the information about relief centers and users. Each relief center entry in the database includes fields such as name, type (shelter, food, medical), latitude, longitude, address, phone number, and last update time. When the user searches for nearby help, the website’s backend connects to Supabase, retrieves all relief centers, and calculates which ones are within a 25-kilometer radius of the user’s current location using the Haversine formula. The results are then sent back to the front end, which displays them live on the map. Supabase also provides real-time updates, meaning if a new shelter or resource is added to the database, it automatically appears on all users’ maps without needing to refresh the page.

The frontend of the website is built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, making the interface modern, clean, and mobile-friendly. The backend can be developed using Node.js (Express) or Python Flask, which communicates with Supabase through its REST API or JavaScript client library. Supabase is also responsible for managing user preferences and notifications. For example, if a user signs up to receive alerts, their phone number and location are stored securely in the database. When a new relief center is added nearby, the system can use an API like Twilio to send an SMS alert.

Supabase provides strong security and privacy features such as Row Level Security (RLS), authentication, and data encryption, ensuring that user data and location information are protected. It also helps with scalability, since Supabase’s cloud infrastructure can handle many users at once without slowing down. If external APIs like Open Data Canada temporarily fail, the system can use cached data from Supabase to continue working, which improves reliability and error handling.

Overall, this website combines real-time data, secure storage, and interactive design to create a functional, user-friendly disaster recovery platform. It meets all the MEC 2025 competition requirements by demonstrating clear user interaction, efficient data processing, robust error handling, scalable performance, strong API integration, and effective security and privacy practices. The Post-Disaster Relief Resource Locator provides a practical solution for communities during and after disasters, helping users quickly locate essential resources and stay informed in critical situations.
